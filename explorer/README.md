Explorer

Explore files in JS. Obviously, it will not modify any file on your server. It will only make a metro UI where you can browse through your files easily.
It also has some features to help you creating dialogs, getting file extensions, changing icons background color and so. There is an extension which will help you on uploading files through Explorer.
You can know more about this Explorer and also get its documentation at www.metroui.us/Explorer

I hope you like it :)
