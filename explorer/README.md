Explorer

Explore files in JS. Obviously, it will not modify any file on your server. It will only make a metro UI where you can browse through your files easily.
It also has some features to help you creating dialogs, getting file extensions, changing icons background color and so. There is an extension which will help you on uploading files through Explorer.
You can know more about Explorer and also get its documentation at www.metroui.us/Explorer

I am also using it on my own cloud storage web site. Check this out -> www.heyupload.us xD

<p style="color: red;">*****Update: I have updated Explorer's code in order to make it totally compatible with
 ECMA6 import stuff. However, it is not working propely after minification, I am still trying to figure out why.
 If you got interested, you can clone it from <a href="https://app.assembla.com/spaces/explorer-/git/source/explorer-module?type=branch">"explorer-module"</a> branch.
 I gonna put it in the master branch as soon as I got it fully working.

I hope you like it :)
