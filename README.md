<h2>Metro-Explorer</h2>
<p>
It's a simple library which may help you to handle files with JS. It may be used to display files a user has
uploaded to your server. You only need to pass them as JS Objects and they will be displayed. You can also add a context menu
which will be displayed when a user right click on a file.
You may know more about it checking the master branch or at <a href="http://www.metroui.us" target="_blank">www.metroui.us.</a>

<p>
Btw, in this branch. I am reimpleting Metro-Explorer using Typescript, Vue JS and Stylus.
</p>
<h4> Why am I doing it? </h4>
<p>
The current code is very messy, you probably have noticed. When I first implemented it, I did not know too much about coding rules, best practices and so. So, by now
I just want make it better and if someone wants to customize it to their needs, it will be easier.
</p>
<h4> How do I get it running? </h4>
<p>
After you fork it, just run yarn/npm install to download its dependencies and then "npm run hot".
If you have any questions about how it is getting built, just check
